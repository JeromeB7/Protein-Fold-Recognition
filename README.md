# Protein-Fold-Recognition
Protein fold recognition is a real-world complex problem crucial for drug discovery. Different machine learning models have been explored for this task, but their performance has been limited by feature extraction methods and dataset complexity. In this study, ProtBERT embeddings were used to transform protein sequences into meaningful representations. Three datasets were used: DD, EDD, and TG. It was found that XGBoost performed the best on the DD dataset with 90.0% accuracy, while MLP achieved the highest accuracy on the EDD (89.0%) and TG (87.0%) datasets. Moreover, a Quantum Hybrid DNN model was compared with a classical DNN of the same architecture and was found to outperform the latter, showcasing the potential of quantum computing in solving complex real-world problems
